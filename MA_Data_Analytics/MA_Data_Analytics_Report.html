    <h1>School District Rating for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>As a by-product of the digital revolution, data is collected
    at an exponential rate. And the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is no exception.
    Currently, the Commonwealth collects over 300 columns of data about schools
    and school districts that range from addresses to enrollment by grade
    to how many attempts for AP tests are taken. <br /><br />

    And with this data comes the question, "Can data be leveraged to improve
    school regions?"<br /><br />
    This analysis provides one solution to rating a school district by its schools'
    performance. With this, administrators can</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Strategically redistribute resources as needed.</li>
      <li>Examine schools in successful Districts in depth to communicate successful tactics.</li>
      <li>If school administrators believe that certain possible treatment
      streams can improve Districts.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Heatmap of School District rating</h2>
    <p>To obtain one score for a District, 6 subscores were calculated and then
    combined into one value:</p>

      <li>High school to college rates.</li>
      <li>High school SAT scores.</li>

    <h2>How the Analysis was Conducted</h2>
    <p>A data set of publicfly available data from the Commonwealth of
      Masachussets was obtained from Kaggel. From that, several aggregations of
      the data took place at the school district level to compile 6 sub-scores.<br />

      For each district, the sub-scores were then input as variables of a
      linear function. The coefficients are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>0.50 : Whether or not a District has enough of the right schools to educate all grades from 1 to 12.</li>
      <li>0.15 : Graduation rates by District.</li>
      <li>0.10 : High school to college rates.</li>
      <li>0.15 : High school SAT scores.</li>
      <li>0.03 : Accountability and Assistance (aggregated by School).</li>
      <li>0.07 : Accountability and Assistance (according to the Commonwealth of Masachussets)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This function has a range of 0 (worst) to 1 (best).
    </p>
    <h2>Future Analysis</h2>
    <p>While this current view is primarily for administrators and other key
      decision makers, the general public can benefit from other data the
      Commonwealth of Massachusetts collects. Examples include demographic data, school
      population, and standardized test scores (MCAS). Concerned citizens could
      plan trips or exchange students using the data here to guide them.<br /><br />

      With historical data, administrators could see how regions trend over time.
      Once identified, the data from a troubled region can be analyzed to find what
      caused this reduction. From there, administrators could decide if a
      certain kind of intervention like auditing their procedures, checking
      more closely that problems identified in a previous inspection have
      been addressed, or even simply contacting the necessary people to ascertain
      why the apparant problem even exist and if mitigating circumstances
      exist. Once a problem has been identified, administrators can take action
      to assist whatever entity - be it school, school district, or school
      system - to improve their performance. <br /><br />

      Sentiment analysis of social media feed could provide another insight into
      school health. However, other than verifying the accuracy of that model
      it may not be advised as public opinion does change. Also, those who post
      may not reflect the true sentiment of the population.
